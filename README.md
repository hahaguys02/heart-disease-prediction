Logistic Regression model for heart disease detection with data preprocessing and Streamlit UI

Hello guys, its my first project while learning ML.
So there might be many things that can be corrected. But i think someone who is learning can find this project very helpful. 

This project predicts heart disease presence using Logistic Regression on the Hungarian Heart Disease dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
[Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)

## How to run
1. Place the dataset file inside the `dataset/heartdisease/` folder.
2. Install required Python libraries:
